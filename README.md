# SlashTest
A discord bot writen in Python

## What is this code for? 
This code is a development flow used to try and understand discord Slash Commands using Discord.py and Discord-py-slash-command repositories. 

## Is this code Free to use? 
Sure, this code is free to use but be aware it is liekely to have major bugs in it and will not be performant as I am new to coding. If these things don't put you off go a head. 

## The bot is missing a token. 
You need to create a file in lib/bot called token.0 and place your bot's token in there. Then it should work.
